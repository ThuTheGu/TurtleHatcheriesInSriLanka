        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Turtles are one of the most important animlas in the world.In past there is a high turtle habitat in the world.But due to many reasons turtle habitat in the world and in Sri lanka are decreasing.That is becoming a huge loss for environment and for biodiversity.So we must protect our turtle habitat.We can do many things to protect our turtle habitat.Some examples are coastal clean-ups,turtle hatcheires and turtle conservation projects.So by doing this kind of things we can protect and increase our turtle habitat.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are many threats to the turtles.Those are can be human threats or natural threats.But nowadays human therats overtake natural threats.That because many man made projects are developing in coastal regions.So that becoming a huge risk for turtle habitat.So we must protect our turtle habitat.Here are some threats to turtles:</p>

        <h2>What Are The Threats To Turtles</h2>
        <p>Turtles are one of the most important and one of the endagered animals in the world.So we must protect the turtle habitat.Recently turtle habitat is decreasing rapidly.One of the main reason for that is the threats to tirtles.There are thrats to turtle.Some examples are pollution,climate change,illegal trade and many more threats.Because of those threats nowadays turtle habitat is decreasing rapidly.So our duty is give the fullest support to protect and increase the turtle habitat.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <h2>Why Are Turtle Habitat Is Decreasing?</h2>
        <p>In many years ago turtle habitat is very rich.There are lots of turtles live around the world.But nowadays turtle habitat is becreasing rapidly.There are many reasons for that.One main reason is the man made causes.Some examples are unorganized coasta clean-up programmes,projects in coastal areas,illegal trade and many more.Beacuse of those reasons turtle habitat is decreasing rapidly.Another reason is natural causes like climate change.It is also a mani reason for decteasing the turtle habitat.So we must protect the turtle habitat.</p>

        <h2>Main Reasons For Decreasing The Turtle Habitat</h2>
        <p>Turtle are very unique and beautiful animals in the animal kingdom.Tutrles are one of the main sea ceatures in the sea world.But nowadays turtle habitat is decreasing rapidly.There are many reasons for that.One reason is plastics and polythenes.When we throw polythenes to the beaches turtles eat those.So because of that turtles are dying.Another main reasons are the threats to the turtles.Some examples are illegal trade,climate change,pollution and many more threats.Because of those threats turtle habitat is decreasing rapidly.So we must protect the turtle habitat.</p>

        <h1>Threats To Turtles</h1>
        <p>Turtles are one of the most beautiful animals in the world.Turtles are endagered animal in the world.Many people love to see turtles.Turtles are simply recognized as one of the most beautiful animals in the world.But nowadays turtle habitat is decreasing.There are many reasons and causes for that.One of the main reason is the human activities.Due to many human activities turtle habitat is decreasing daily.Some examples are coastal projects,unorganized coastal clean-up programmes and many more activities.Because of those reasins turtle habitat is decreasing rapidly.Another main reason is natural causes like climate change.Climate change plays an major role for decreasing the turtle habitat.So as humans we need protect the environment.So there are many reasons for turtle habiat decreasing rapidly.Another main reasons are threats to turtles.Here are some threats to turtles:</p>

        <img src="./illegeag trade.jpg" alt="illegal trade">
        <h2>1. Over Harvesting And Illegal Trade</h2>
        <p>Over harvesting and illegal trading is now becoming one of the main threats to turtles.Turtles are continued to be harvested unsuctainably.Many people do that for get meat and eggs as a food source.Some killing turtles for medicines and religious ceremonies.Because of those reasons turtle habitat decreasing annually.So we must take legal actions and we must protect turtle habitat.</p>

        <h2>2. Habitat Loss</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Turtles make their nests on beaches.But due to unorganized coastal developments and vehicle traffic those turtle nests are destroying everyday.Many human activities in coastal regions are destroying turtle nests bescause of that female turtles can not lay their eggs.So then turtle habitat will decrease rapidly.So we must protect coastal regions and turtle nests to increase the turtle habitat. </p>

        <h2>3. Climate Change</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Climate change plays a critical role in turtle habitat loss.Climate conditions like temperature is very important to turtles.Warm temperature will affect turtle's behaviours.Severe storms,Tsunamis and sea level rising also affect the nesting of turtles.So as humans we protect our environment to increase and protect turtle habitat.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Polythenes,plastics and rubbish are the main pollutants that are serious threats to turtles.Turtles eat those things are because those things do not digest they simply dying.Oil spill also a main threat to turtles.Most oil spills are caused by ship accidents.Oil are heavily poisioned to turtles and turtles are dying including baby turtles. So we must stop throwing polythenes,plastics and rubbish to the sea and to the beach.We can organize coastal clean-ups.We can implement new rules to protect our coastal regions and out turtle habital.By then we can increase out turtle habitat and protect our turtle habitat.</p>

        <h1>Threats To Turtles Solutions</h1>
        <p>There are lots of threats to the turtles.Some threats are pollution,illegal trade,climate change and habitat loss.Due to those threats turtle habitat is now decreasing rapidly.Many turtle eggs and turtle babies lost their life.Turtles lost their natural homes.Because of that turtles can't lay their eggs.Because of those reasons turtle habitat is decreasing rapidly.So as humans our duty is to protect the turtle habitat.We can do many things to protect and increase the turtle habitat.Some examples are imposing laws,Prepairing turtle hatchery centers,organize coastal clean-up programmes and many more things.By doing those kind of things we can protect and increase the turtle habitat.By protecting and increasing turtle habitat we can give turtles a good life and rich future.here are some of the solutions we can do to reduce the threats to turtles:</p>
    <div class="row2">
    <div class="innerdetails-column">
        <img src="./id1.jpg" alt="Turtle">
        <h2>1. Imposing laws</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Illegal trade and overharvesting is one of the main threats to turtles.Because of this many turtle loss their life and it will become a major reason for decreasing the turtle habitat.So to control the illegal trade and overharvesting we can impose new rules.So then we can punish the people who are doing illegal trade and overharvesting.So it will help to reduce the overharvesting and illegal trade.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="innerdetails-column">
        <img src="./id2.jpg" alt="Turtle">
        <h2>2. Prepairing turtle hatcheries</h2>
        <p>One of the main solution for protect and increase the turtle habitat is to develop more turtle hatcheries.It will help to protect more turtle eggs and more turtle babies.And it will help to protect and increase the turtle habitat.In turtle hatcheries we can oraganize many conservation projects it will help to protect and increase the turtle habitat.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="innerdetails-column">
        <img src="./id3.jpg" alt="Turtle">
        <h2>3. Minimize climate change impact</h2>
        <p>Climate change is becimg one of the main reasonss for the decreasing of the turtle habitat.Due to changing the climate conditions many turtles change their home beaches and it will negatively affect to their lifecycle.Because of climate change many turtles lost their life too.Because of this turtle habitat is decreasing.So as humans we can reduce the climate change.We can reduce the releasing of CO2 and also we can reduce the activities that are harmful to the environment.By then we can reduce the impaact of cilmate change.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="innerdetails-column">
        <img src="./id4.jpg" alt="Turtle">
        <h2>4. Organizing coastal clean-up programmes</h2>
        <p>One of the main reasons that the turtles are dying is plastics and polythenes.When people throwing plastics and polythenes to the beach turtles are eating those things.But those thing are not digesting.So because of that many turtle are dying.So as humans we can solve this problem by organizing coastal clean-up programmes.By organizinh these programmes we can remove plastics and polythenes form the beach.So it will help to protect the turtle habitat.</p>
